As a web developer, I was part of a team tasked to create a digital Christmas card for Techniker Krankenkasse employees and clients.
The project was built using React, incorporating Lottie animations to bring a cartoon-style illustration to life.
I was responsible for developing the website's functionality, ensuring a high-quality and user-friendly interface, 
and ensuring responsiveness for all devices. 
The final product featured animated illustrations and links to blog articles from Techniker Krankenkasse.
This project showcases my ability to work within a team to develop a fully functional website using modern web technologies, 
and my commitment to delivering a seamless user experience.
