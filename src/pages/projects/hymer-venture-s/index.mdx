Our team was responsible for upgrading the product pages for Hymer's vehicles, with a focus on the Venture S model as the pilot project. 
The goal was to create an impressive and innovative design 
that would showcase the features of the new product using effects and animations.

To achieve this, we utilized existing Storybook infrastructure and built upon it using 
Twig, SCSS, and JavaScript. We incorporated new technology 
such as GSAP ScrollTrigger and ScrollSmoother to enhance the user experience with reveal effects and parallax effects.

The resulting product page for the Venture S model was visually impressive, 
highlighting the innovation of the product and effectively conveying the brand's message. 
Overall, our team successfully upgraded Hymer's product pages with an enhanced user experience, 
resulting in a satisfied client and a successful project.
