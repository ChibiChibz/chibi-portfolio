Our team was tasked with relaunching the marketing website for our client Etrusco. 
The goal of the project was to create a simple and minimalistic website, inspired by the Italian Dolce Vita lifestyle, 
while still effectively emphasizing the Etrusco brand.

To achieve this, we utilized large bold fonts that were strategically placed throughout the website 
to draw attention to key messages and calls-to-action. 
We also incorporated elegant images and design elements that were reminiscent of the Italian culture and lifestyle.

To create a seamless user experience, we used Storybook to build the website using Twig, SCSS, and JavaScript. 
We also incorporated new technology to enhance the user experience, 
including GSAP ScrollTrigger and ScrollSmoother for reveal effects and parallax effects.

Overall, our team was successful in creating a visually stunning website that effectively showcased the Etrusco brand and its products. 
The website not only met the client's expectations but also exceeded them, resulting in a satisfied client and a successful project.
