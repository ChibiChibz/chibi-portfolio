As a developer, I worked on a project for Techniker Krankenkasse, where we developed a digital version of their printed annual report. 
The project was built on custom WordPress and PHP, 
and was designed as a microsite based on the corporate design of Techniker Krankenkasse. 
However, we were also allowed to create custom designs to make it look outstanding.

The project involved several challenges. 
In the previous year, the client had used a module on the homepage that highlighted three topics. 
However, for the current year, they needed to highlight five topics. 
We had to remake the module to incorporate the additional topics.

Additionally, we noticed that some of the displays that looked good when printed looked too static on the website. 
To address this issue, we animated the content to make it more interactive and engaging.

Overall, the project required a deep understanding of custom WordPress and PHP development, 
as well as an eye for design to ensure that the final product was both visually stunning and highly functional. 
With this project, we were able to deliver a digital annual report that met the client's expectations and 
showcased our expertise in web development.
