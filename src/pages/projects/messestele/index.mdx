In this project, we worked with clients Hymer and Eriba to develop an interactive touch display that showcased 
the details of their vehicles at fairs such as Caravan Salon Düsseldorf. 
The display was designed to engage visitors and customers at the fair, 
allowing them to interact with the vehicles in a unique and innovative way.

To start the project, we conducted research to understand the clients' needs and goals for the display, 
as well as the target audience and market trends. Based on the research, 
we proposed a design that incorporated a large touchscreen display, 
featuring high-resolution images and videos of the clients' vehicles. 
The design was also optimized for ease of use and interactivity, with clear call-to-actions and intuitive navigation.

Once the design was finalized, we worked on the development of the touch display 
using the latest interactive technology based on the Storybook pattern library.
The display was designed to be user-friendly, with large, easy-to-read text and intuitive touch controls.
The display featured detailed information on each vehicle, including features, specifications, and pricing.
A feature that was important was offline usage, so we decided to use Firefox' native kiosk mode.

The end result of this project was a unique and innovative touch display that engaged visitors and customers at fairs 
such as Caravan Salon Düsseldorf. 
The display was well-received by both the clients and their customers, resulting in increased engagement and sales for the clients. 
The touch display served as an effective marketing tool, helping to differentiate the clients' vehicles 
from their competitors and showcase the clients' commitment to innovation and customer engagement.
