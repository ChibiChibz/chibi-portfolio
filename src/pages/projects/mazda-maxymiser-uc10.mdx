    'This project involved building a pattern library for a marketing campaign using the Svelte framework and Storybook. The library served as a centralized repository for reusable components and streamlined the process of creating and deploying ad campaigns.',
}

export default (props) => <ProjectLayout meta={meta} {...props} />

The project involves developing a Storybook for the Erwin Hymer Group and its brands. 
The Storybook will showcase the UI components used in the company's websites and applications, 
and provide a centralized environment for designing, testing, and documenting these components.
The development will be done using Twig Templates for creating the component templates, 
SCSS for styling, and JavaScript for adding interactivity. 
The Storybook will be built using the latest web technologies, to ensure compatibility with modern browsers and devices. 
Additionally, the project will utilize libraries such as GSAP for scroll effects and triggers, 
adding smooth and engaging scroll experiences for users.
The goal of this project is to provide a single source of truth for the company's UI components, 
improve collaboration between designers and developers, 
and ensure a consistent user experience across all products and platforms while maintaining each brand's individuality.
