This project involved the development of a pattern library using Storybook for marketing campaigns. 
The purpose of the pattern library was to serve as a centralized repository for reusable components 
that could be easily integrated into marketing websites. 
The components were built using the Svelte framework, 
which allowed for efficient and dynamic updates to be made to the design and functionality of the components. 
The library was implemented using Storybook, providing a user-friendly interface for browsing and previewing the components, 
as well as enabling easy collaboration between team members. 
The final result was a streamlined workflow for creating and deploying ad campaigns, 
saving time and resources for the marketing team.
